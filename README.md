## Additional Libraries/Dependencies

This project uses the following main libraries:

- **Browse by Category**: Click on any of the category buttons (e.g., Sports, Politics) to filter news by that category.
- **Read More**: Click on the "Read More" link to open the full article in a new tab.

## Error Handling
